In this game, a single player participates where a virtual "Simon" or game engine gives commands, and the player has to follow them.
The player earns a performance score based on how successfully they follow the commands.
The goal is typically to follow the commands as quickly and accurately as possible.
It's an entertaining and challenging way to test one's attention and reflexes.
